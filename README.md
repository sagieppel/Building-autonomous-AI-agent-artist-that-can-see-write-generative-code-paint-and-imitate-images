[You can find the full toturial associate with code at this LINK.](https://medium.com/@sagieppel/building-ai-agent-that-can-write-code-see-the-world-paint-pictures-and-search-for-beauty-in-60-21766fe24050)

This project/tutorial goal is to create a program that can see, write its own code, paint images, judge and improve it work (in less then 60 lines of code).
This is bascially toturial for using autonomous AI agents inside python code for tasks envolving vision and coding.

Image_from_concept.py: Use LLM/AI agent to generate code that form image of given textual description

image2code2image.py: Use LLM/AI agen to generate code that form image  base on reference image 

Image_from_concept_recursive_improvment.py: Use LLM/AI agent to generate code that form image of given textual description, but examine the code and improve it in a loop.
